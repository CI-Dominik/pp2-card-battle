            <h2>How to play</h2>

            <p>Welcome to Steampunk Struggle!<br>
            In this card game, your goal is to defeat three enemies by strategically using your cards. 
            The game is turn-based, and the player must balance between attacking enemies and defending 
            against their assaults. You win by defeating all three enemies. However, if you run out of 
            cards or your health reaches 0, you lose.</p>
            
            <h3>Adding Cards to the fight</h3>
            <p>At the start of each turn, you can add cards to your fight stack. 
            To do this, simply click the plus button to add a card. You can keep 
            adding cards until you are satisfied with your stack or run out of cards. 
            Each round after the defense phase, you will draw additional cards 
            until your hand is filled with four of them.
            If you change your mind about the last card added, you can click the 
            undo button to remove it from the stack.
            
            <h3>Starting the fight</h3>
            <p>Once you have prepared your stack, click the checkmark button to 
            begin the battle. The fight is divided into two distinct phases: 
            the attack phase and the defense phase.
            The currently active phase is displayed on the left of the middle
            overview window.</p>
            
            <h3>Attack phase</h3>
            <p>During the attack phase, you will use the cards from your fight stack to 
            attack the enemy. Each card has its own attack power, and the combined force 
            of your selected cards will be applied to damage the enemy. 
            The goal is to reduce the enemy's health to zero to defeat them.
            Should your attack defeat the current enemy, cards left in the stack
            will already damage the upcoming foe.</p>
            
            <h3>Defense phase</h3>
            <p>After the attack phase, the enemy will retaliate. During the defense phase, 
            the enemy attacks you. You will need to add  cards to a defense stack to 
            block the enemy's attack. Each card has its own defensive value, and you must 
            add enough cards to counter the enemy's assault and protect your health. 
            Failing to defend adequately will result in losing large amounts of health.</p>
