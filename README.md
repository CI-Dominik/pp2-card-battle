### WAVE extension
* PH

### Use of font sizes
* Throughout the whole homepage, every element was sized using the rem unit. This way, it is ensured that the experience is the same on any font size setting of the browser. The unit was used to give people who cannot read small texts a better time and feel included.

### Goal of accessibility measures

* Everyone should be able to enjoy the website content, so an alt tag was added to every picture to describe it.<br>
In addition to this, aria labels were added to all buttons to describe their behaviour.<br>
This way, every screen reader should be able to pick of the provided content.<br>
Lastly, the colours of the homepage were chosen to ensure enough contrast for visually impaired users.

## **Deployment**

### Visual Studio Code connection
* A connection between Visual Studio Code and GitHub was established using the built-in function to include the ability to clone, stage, commit and push content directly to GitHub.
Once you start Visual Studio Code with no connection, you simply need to click on the person icon in the lower left corner and select "GitHub". From there, you can connect your existing account to Visual Studio Code.

<br>

### Cloning, commiting and pushing via Visual Studio Code
* Visual Studio code was used to stage all changed files and commit them with an included message directly to GitHub.

<br>

![Screenshot of the menu to commit changes to GitHub](docs/vscode-commit.jpg)

### Deployment via GitHub Pages
* Once a version that should be visible on the internet has been established, to deploy a page, one needs to visit the GitHub repository that is used to store all data of the project.

<br>

![Screenshot of the settings menu in GitHub](docs/deployment4.jpg)

On the top, there is an option that says *Settings*. In this menu, it is possible to deploy the page using the *Pages* sub-menu.

<br>

![Screenshot of the settings list with Pages circled](docs/deployment2.jpg)

Once one clicks on the *Pages* sub-menu, a new page will appear. On this one, one can select the branch of the project which contains the main data to deploy to GitHub Pages. In this case, the branch *Main* was used.

<br>

![Screenshot of the branch selection in GitHub Pages](docs/deployment3.jpg)

With the right branch selected, the input needs to be saved via the *Save* button.

<br>

After the deployment, a link to the deployed page can be found on the frontpage of the GitHub repository. With a click on it to reveal the link that takes the visitor to the live page.
